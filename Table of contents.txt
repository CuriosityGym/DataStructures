1. OOP - Explain concepts
2. TDD an unit testing
3. Stack and paranthesis check example
4. Explain call stack during recursion and plain function call. We will do the call stack activity.
5.Recursion and dynamic programming and how call stack is used here.
Start with fibonacci and factorial and stadium activity and go through all three implemntations of pascal's with dynamic programming
6. Explain queues and usage verbally
Explain trees formed during recursion
7.Pre, in and post order traversals and the shunting yard algorithm and evaluate math expressions and flaws doing it this way.
8,9,10. How does computer evaluate math expressions
FSM activity and BNF form and traffic light example
Convert math expr to fsm and ebnf and to code

Write Lexer, Parser, Interpreter and Visualizer

Concepts: Trees, stack, queue, pre, post and inorder and breadth first traversal
